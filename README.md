- The gameplay Graphics is good enough and the controls are simple for the users. 
- Talking about the gameplay, it’s one of the most addictive and played games for all.
- All you have to do is just try to stay in the middle of the screen until long blocks appear in front of you. Here, the user has to control the ghost flapping up,
  down using Spacebar, without touching blocks in order to score game points. This means the more you pass through block, more will be the game points.
- A simple GUI is provided for the easy gameplay. The gameplay design is so simple that user won’t find it difficult to use and navigate.
- Use ↑ or Space key to play and Esc to close the game.
